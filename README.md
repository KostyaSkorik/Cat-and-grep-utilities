# Simple Bash Utiles

## As part of my studies at school â„–21, I implemented my own versions of embedded Linux utilities (cat and grep) in the C language. My code is in the develop branch.

## During the implementation of this project, I mastered and put into practice file management technologies such as writing, output, copying, and others.

## In addition, I wrote my own bash scripts to test the utilities I created and compare them with the original version.
